Variant 1:

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth + 1 largest element in an array.

Notice that it is the kth + 1 largest element in the sorted order, not the kth + 1 distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

Element 1:

  Input: nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2
  Output: 4

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6], k =4
  Output: 3

Variant 2:

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest element in an array.

Notice that it is the kth smallest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

Element 1:

  Input: nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4], k = 2
  Output: 2

Example 2:
  Input: nums = [3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6], k = 4
  Output: 3
