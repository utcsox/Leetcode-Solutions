Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the beginning of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must be do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

  Input:  nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
  Output: [0,0,1,3,12]

Example 2:

  Input: nums = [0]
  Output: [0]
