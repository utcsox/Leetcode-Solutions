Perform a right shift operation on a string in which:
*  Every lowercase English character is replaced with the successive character of the alphabet, wrapping from "z" to "a".
*  Every uppercase English character is replaced with the successive character of the alphabet, wrapping from "Z" to "A".
*  Every numeric character is replaced with the successive digit, wrapping from 9 to 0.

Note:  non-alphanumeric characters should remain unchanged.

Return the result after rotating the input string a number of times equal to rotationalFactor.

Example 1:
  Input: string = "minMerz-894", rotationalFactor = 5
  Output: "rnRjwe-349"

Example 2:
  Input: strings = "XYZ_abo_112288", rotationalFactor = 39
  Output: "KLM_nob_001177"

Constraints:
* 1 <= string.length <= 1,000,000
* 0 <= rotationalFactor <= 1,000,000
