A phrase is a palindrome if, after excluding any characters outside of a given vector of characters include, it reads the same forward and backward.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "racecarX", include = ["r", "X"]
Output: false
Explanation: "rrx" is not a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input: s = "Yo, banana boY", include = ["Y", "o", "b", "a", "n"]
Output: true
Explanation: "YobananaboY" is a palindrome.
