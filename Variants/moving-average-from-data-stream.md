Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `size`, compute the average elements in a sliding window of exactly `size` elements.
Return a list containing the results of these computations using integer division.

**Example 1:**

  Input: nums = [5, 2, 8, 14, 3]
  Output: [5, 8, 8]

  Explanation:
  The first window is (5 + 2 + 8 ) / 3 = 5
  The second window is (2 + 8 + 14) /3 = 8
  The third window is (8 + 14 + 3) / 3 = 8
